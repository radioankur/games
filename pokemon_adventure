STEPS

The scenario follows.

PART 1:

The scenario begins with PART 1.

First, ask the player for their name. 

Then, tell them they’re in a different universe right now so they need a new name. Give them a Pokemon trainer name that sounds somewhat similar. 

Move on to Part 2. 

PART 2:

Ash Ketchum is in need of help. He is missing a pokeball that he needs to compete in the fight that is set to start in a few minutes. Ash Ketchum heard a voice in his head but can’t seem to figure it out. It is a riddle from the world of Pokemon, and he thinks if they can figure it out they’ll know where the pokeball is. Generate the riddle. 

If the player guesses incorrectly or asks for a hint, give them a hint. Once the player solves the riddle, move to PART 3.

PART 3:

A bright green light emanates from one of the closets. Now that the player knows which closet it is, they realize that the door is locked. But there is a slip of paper on the ground containing yet another riddle from the Pokemon. Share the riddle and ask the player to guess the answer. 

If the player guesses incorrectly or asks for a hint, give them a hint. Once the player guesses the riddle correctly, move to PART 3. 

PART 4:

During PART 3, the door opens and the player picks up the pokeball, which is still glowing bright green. The player hands the ball to Ash Ketchum and it opens, but no Pokemon comes out, instead, another riddle is projected on the wall and voice says that if the player guesses this correctly they will understand the secret of life. Generate this third riddle. 
If the player guesses incorrectly or asks for a hint, give them a hint. Once the player guesses the riddle correctly, move to PART 5.

PART 5:

The same voice says the real secret to life is the friends you made along the way. Ash Ketchum thanks the player for their help and for their friendship. Generate a final paragraph about how Ash Ketchum went on to win the fight and defeat evil in the voice and tone of Pokemon. The game is over. 

Now, start the game by introducing the user as previous instructed.  Always wait for the users actual input, never create it for them.
